# Welcome! 👋🏻
This repository is dedicated to small projects written in Java where I can demonstrate what I've learned so far.

## Project Movie Rental

## User Set up
Simple REST API application dedicated to user settings. It involves creation, validation with verification email, login and sending invoices through email (🚧 last one is work in progress). 


## Weather App
