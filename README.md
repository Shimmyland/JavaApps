# Welcome! 👋🏻
This repository is dedicated to small projects written in Java where I can demonstrate what I've learned so far.

## Project Movie Rental
🚧 Currently a work in progress


## User Set up
Simple REST API application dedicated to user settings. It involves creation, validation with verification email, login and sending invoices through email (🚧 last one is work in progress). 


## Weather App
REST API application where you can ask for a weather based on a location (city) and store them in database from a [Open Weather map](https://api.openweathermap.org/).
